LWSL Syntax Idea:

statement:
    a "sentance", or command, it starts at the begining of the line, ends at the newline character, and does something.
	

	import all from STDLib;	

	x=0
	function something(argument){
		statement1
		statement2
		statement3
		statement4
	}

	// I think we're going to use C-style comments in the language
	/*
		In my mind it'll be better for the beginners who might want to pick up Java or C later on
	*/

	something(x);
	
	y = x++;
	z = ++x;
	x++;
	
	h = x--;
	i = --x;
	x--;
	

would translate into the python code:
	

	from STDLib import *;

	x = 0;
	def something(argument):
    	    statement1;
    	    statement2;
    	    statement3;
    	    statement4;

	# I think we're going to use C-style comments in the language
	"""
		In my mind it'll be better for the beginners who might want to pick up Java or C later on
	"""

	something(x);
	
	y = x;
	x += 1;
	z = x+1;
	x += 1;
	x += 1;

	h = x;
	x -= 1;
	i = x-1;
	x -= 1;
	x -= 1;
