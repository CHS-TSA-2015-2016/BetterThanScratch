LWSL Syntax Idea:

statement:
    a "sentance", or command, it starts at the begining of the line, ends at the newline character, and does something.
	

	import all from STDLib
	import item from MyLib
	
	// my ____ means ____ allows you to define tokens, bascially, this tells the interpreter to replace all tokens PI with 3.1415926
	my PI means 3.1415926

	x=0
	function something(argument){
		statement1
		statement2
		statement3
		statement4
	}

	// I think we're going to use C-style comments in the language
	/*
		In my mind it'll be better for the beginners who might want to pick up Java or C later on
	*/

	something(x)
	
	y = x+3
	z = y-(100*x)
	x -= 1
	
	array = []
	
	// add ____ to ____ allows us to add a new element to the array	
	add "0" to array
	add "1" to array
	add "Hello" to array
	add "World" to array

	array[0] = "not 0";

	while(x > 125){
		statement
		x -= 1
	}
	
	for(index=0; index<123; index+=1){
		statement
	}
	
	for(index in array){
		statement
	}
	
	if(x == 0){
		//something
	} else if(x == 1){
		//something else
	} else {
		//something completely different.
	}

	// choice is basically a switch statment
	choice(x){
		option 0 {
			// do something
		}
		
		option 1 {
			// do something else
		}
		
		option 2 {
			// some other thing
		}

		option "hello"{
			// something else
		}
	
		none {
			// do something else entirely
		}
	}

would translate into the python code:
	

	from STDLib import *;
	from MyLib import item;

	# my ____ means ____ allows you to define tokens, basically, this tells the interpreter to replace all tokesn PI with 3.1415926
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{my and means doesn't get interpreted into python, that's for us to use.}

	x = 0;
	def something(argument):
    	    statement1;
    	    statement2;
    	    statement3;
    	    statement4;

	# I think we're going to use C-style comments in the language
	"""

	"""

	something(x);
	
	y = x + 3;
	z = y-(100*x);
	x -= 1;

	while x > 125:
	    statement;
	    x -= 1;
	
	for index in range(123):
		statement;

	if x == 0:
